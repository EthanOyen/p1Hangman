Objective: Make a hangman game

Algorithm:
    1. Define function that randomly selects word from a text dictionary/list
    2. Define function that takes input from the user for each letter guessed
    3. Define function that takes letter guessed correctly and turns it into a string
    4. Create variables to store data that the user enters
        a. Create variable that stores the word the computer picks
        b. Create 2 variables, one that stores correctly guessed letters and one that stores incorrectly guessed letters
    5. Display an introduction to the program so the users will know what to do
    6. Create loop that will allow the user to keep guessing until either they win or run out of tries
    7. Add statements at beginning and end of game to welcome them and then thank them for playing
